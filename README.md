# Calculator App\n\nA basic calculator application built with JavaScript and styled using Bootstrap.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Summary](#summary)\n- [Setup](#setup)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Code Explanation](#code-explanation)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis project is a simple web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). It features a clean, responsive user interface designed with Bootstrap 5.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo set up the project locally, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://your-repo-link/calculator-app-js-bootstrap.git\n    cd calculator-app-js-bootstrap\n    ```\n\n2.  **Open `index.html`:**\n    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No special server or build process is required.\n\n## Usage\n\n-   **Input Numbers:** Click the number buttons (0-9) to enter digits into the display.\n-   **Operators:** Click the operator buttons (+, -, \*, /) to perform arithmetic operations.\n-   **Clear:** Click the "C" button to clear the current input and reset the calculator.\n-   **Calculate:** Click the "=" button to evaluate the expression and display the result.\n-   **Decimal:** Use the "." button for decimal numbers.\n\n## Code Explanation\n\n### `index.html`\n\nThis file sets up the basic structure of the calculator. It includes:\n\n-   **Bootstrap 5 CSS:** For responsive design and styling of buttons and layout.\n-   **Custom `style.css`:** For additional visual enhancements specific to the calculator.\n-   **Input Display:** An `<input type="text" id="display" disabled>` element to show the current input and results.\n-   **Calculator Buttons:** A grid of buttons (`<button>`) for numbers, operators, clear, and equals. Each button has an `onclick` event handler that calls a JavaScript function (`appendToDisplay`, `clearDisplay`, `calculateResult`).\n\n### `style.css`\n\nThis file contains custom CSS rules to style the calculator beyond what Bootstrap provides. Key styles include:\n\n-   Centering the calculator on the page.\n-   Setting the width, border-radius, and box-shadow for the calculator card.\n-   Styling the display input for better readability.\n-   Adjusting button sizes and padding.\n-   Ensuring the equals button spans two rows for a classic calculator look.\n\n### `script.js`\n\nThis file contains the core JavaScript logic for the calculator:\n\n-   `display`: A reference to the input element where numbers and results are shown.\n-   `currentInput`: A string variable that stores the user\'s current input/expression.\n-   `appendToDisplay(value)`: Appends the clicked button\'s `value` to `currentInput` and updates the display.\n-   `clearDisplay()`: Resets `currentInput` and clears the display.\n-   `calculateResult()`: \n    -   Uses `eval()` to evaluate the `currentInput` as a JavaScript expression. \n    -   **Note:** While `eval()` is used here for simplicity in a basic example, it is generally **not recommended for production applications** due to potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., arbitrary code execution if user input is not sanitized). For a more robust solution, a custom parsing and evaluation engine or a safe math expression library should be used.\n    -   Handles potential errors during calculation (e.g., invalid expressions) by displaying "Error".\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
